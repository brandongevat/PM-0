# Author: Brandon Gevat - COP-3402 - PM/0

This is a PM/0 machine, written for COP-3402 (Systems Software) - Euripedes Montagne. The idea is to understand how programs run at the machine level.

## Compile & run using:
```sh
gcc vm.c
./a.out <filename>.txt
```

## For example:
```
gcc vm.c
./a.out test1.txt
```

- **The program may ask you for your input, please follow the input instructions in the command line..**

- This program will generate the stacktrace in *stacktrace.txt*.
